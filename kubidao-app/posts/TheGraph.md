# Poa Upgrades to The Graph’s Decentralized Network: Empowering Perpetual Organizations with Fully Decentralized Data

We are excited to announce a significant improvement to our platform: upgrading our subgraphs to The Graph's decentralized network. The Graph enables access to decentralized data through their network of Indexers, Delegators, and Curators, ensuring transparency and accessibility. 

This upgrade is a crucial step towards our mission of creating truly decentralized, employee-owned organizations. The public nature of subgraphs means that anyone can easily access data from any Perpetual Organization. We are proud to say that The Graph meets the high standard of decentralization Poa maintains, and what we do wouldn’t be possible without it.

## How Poa Utilizes The Graph

Poa utilizes The Graph to track the data of deployed Perpetual Organizations automatically. By leveraging a subgraph template method, we efficiently index and query information related to voting mechanisms, role creation, task management, and fundraising activities for all Perpetual Organizations deployed using our factory contracts. This automation not only enhances the user experience but also makes it easy for Perpetual Organizations to take full control of their data whenever their team gets big enough by simplifying hosting their own frontend and using the public subgraph API.

### Some Examples:

- **Voting Systems**: By indexing voting data, we provide real-time updates on election results, ensuring transparency and trust within the organization.
- **Automated Task Management**: We track task assignments and completions, allowing for seamless automation of payouts and task tracking.
- **Fundraising and Treasury Management**: Our subgraphs monitor NFT sales, donations, and treasury activities, giving organizations a clear view of their financial health.

## The Path Forward

Upgrading to The Graph’s decentralized network marks a significant milestone in our journey to revolutionize organizational structures. By ensuring all aspects of a Perpetual Organization are easily queryable without compromising on decentralization, we empower employees to take control of their organizations with confidence. 

This upgrade is not just about technology; it's about creating a fairer, more equitable future where everyone has a stake in their workplace.

Join us on this exciting journey as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized technologies. With The Graph, Poa is poised to redefine the way organizations operate, ensuring that they are truly owned by those who run them.
