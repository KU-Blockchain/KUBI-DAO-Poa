## Deciding on Voting Mechanisms

One of the core features of any organization is its voting system, and with Poa, you have the flexibility to choose from several innovative options:

- **Hybrid Voting**: This method allows you to balance between contribution-based voting and direct democracy, tailoring how each is weighted in decision-making processes. [Learn about why this is useful](https://poa.community/docs/hybridVoting).
- **Contribution-based Voting**: Your members' voting power correlates with their activity and contributions to the organization, ensuring that those who invest effort have a greater say.
- **Direct Democracy**: Each member has an equal vote, promoting fairness and equality within your organization.

Additionally, you can set a voting quorum percentage and decide whether to implement quadratic voting, enhancing the democratic quality by curbing the influence of large stakeholders.

## Task and Role Management

Poa empowers you to define specific roles within your organization, assigning permissions that align with your operational needs. Each role can have different capabilities such as creating various types of votes (direct democracy, contribution-based, or hybrid), managing tasks, reviewing tasks, and updating site information.

## Upgrade and Treasury Management

Poa will ask you what voting type can update the smart contracts and move money from the treasury. This ensures that your organization can continue to evolve over time while remaining fully controlled by the community, thats why we call them Perpetual Organizations.
