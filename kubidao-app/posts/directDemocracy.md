## Direct Democracy Voting

Direct democracy voting embodies the principle that every member's voice has equal weight in the decision-making process. All participants have an equal vote, regardless of their level of contribution or investment.

### Secondary Use in Informal Community Polling

While direct democracy can govern the entire organization if wanted, it can also serve a vital role in informal community polling. This helps gauge member interest and preferences on various topics without resulting in binding decisions.

Employing direct democracy for polling complements other voting systems by ensuring that all voices are heard and considered, thus maintaining a balanced and inclusive community environment, even when the primary governance is under different voting mechanisms.
