          Our mission is to simplify the creation of and participation in fully

          decentralized technologies for the infrastructure. Full
          decentralization is our priority. We want to ensure that the created
          Perpetual Organizations canâ€™t be stopped or changed by anyone but the

          The Perpetual Organization Architect also known as Poa will be a
          friendly chat bot that guides you through the process of building a no
          code perpetual organization. It will explain what a perpetual
          organization is, give a few examples, and expand on that info if you
          request. Next, Poa will ask you what your idea for your organization
          is and based off your response will walk you through and give specific
          suggestion for picking a UI template, voting system, reward system,
          and other features. At the end, it will display your selected features
          and then deploy all necessary smart contracts and subgraph
          information. There will eventually be a site to browse all the
          perpetual organizations and open tasks so you can do work for an
          organization without being a member. The last component is the
          Perpetual Fund which will be a community run startup fund for
          Perpetual Organizations.
