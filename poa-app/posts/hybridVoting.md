# What is Hybrid Voting?

Hybrid voting is a system that merges two primary forms of governance:

- **Direct Democracy**: Every member has an equal vote, reflecting the pure democratic principle that each individual's opinion carries equal weight.
- **Contribution-based Voting**: Members earn voting power based on their contributions to the organization, whether through work, resources, or other forms of involvement.

This dual approach allows organizations on Poa to tailor their decision-making processes in a way that balances equity with meritocracy. 

### Example: 80% Contribution, 20% Democracy

Imagine a Perpetual Organization using an 80/20 hybrid voting model—80% of voting power comes from contributions, while 20% is based on equal member voting.

**Scenario**: The PO needs to choose a new project to undertake. 

The 80% voting power allocated to contributors ensures that those who will be actively building the project can signal their willingness to complete the project. 

The remaining 20% democratic vote allows the broader community to confirm their interest in the project itself, aligning the project's execution with community demand.

## Advantages of Hybrid Voting

### **Alignment of Interests**
Hybrid voting ensures that the interests of active contributors are balanced with the broader community's desires. This alignment is crucial for maintaining harmony and motivation within the organization, as it recognizes both the voice and the effort of its members.

### **Flexibility in Governance**
Organizations can adjust the weight given to direct votes versus contribution-based votes based on their specific needs and goals. This flexibility allows for dynamic governance that can evolve as the organization grows or as its objectives change.

### **Encourages Participation**
Knowing that both their democratic choice and their contributions influence decisions, members are more likely to participate actively. This increased engagement can lead to more informed decisions and a more vibrant community.

### **Enhanced Fairness**
By integrating both voting methods, hybrid voting can mitigate the risks associated with each system when used alone. It prevents disproportionate influence that may arise solely from wealth or tenure, while still rewarding those who actively contribute to the organization’s success.

## Conclusion

Hybrid voting on Poa offers a balanced, flexible, and fair way to govern decentralized organizations. It is designed to ensure that the actions taken not only reflect the collective will of the community but also respect and reward the contributions of its most active members. By adopting hybrid voting, Poa platforms can foster a cooperative, productive, and engaged community, driving the organization towards shared success.
