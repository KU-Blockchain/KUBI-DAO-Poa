# Contribution-based Voting

Contribution-based voting grants voting power based on members' active participation and investment in the organization, measured through the decentralized task manager. 

This system rewards those who contribute the most, whether through labor, resources, or ideas, with greater influence over decision-making processes.

### Contributors and Community First
Contribution-based voting ensures that power resides with active workers and contributors, rather than investors or wealthy stakeholders.
