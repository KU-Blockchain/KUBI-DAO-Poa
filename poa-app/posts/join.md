# How to Join a Perpetual Organization

Joining a Perpetual Organization (PO) through the Poa platform offers a seamless gateway into the world of worker-owned and community-driven initiatives. Here’s a comprehensive guide to get you started on your journey.

### **Choose Your Sign-in Method**
To join a PO, you need a digital identity. Poa provides two convenient options:

1. **Magic Link**: For a hassle-free sign-in experience, Poa supports Magic Link, an email-based authentication that simplifies access without compromising security. This option does not require handling private keys directly.
   
2. **Use Your Own Wallet**: If you prefer full control, connect using a blockchain-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. This method allows you to manage transactions and interact directly with blockchain features.


### **Ensure You’re on the Correct Blockchain Network**
Poa’s Perpetual Organizations operate on specific blockchain networks. Make sure your wallet is set to the correct network, such as Ethereum or Polygon, to ensure seamless interactions. Poa will prompt you to chnage netowrks if needed. 

### **Acquire Necessary Tokens**
Participation in some POs on Poa may require holding certain tokens for gas fees. Some POs are set up to pay gas fees for you. Acquire these tokens through exchanges or direct transactions as needed.

## Joining the Organization

Once your sign-in method is established and you have the necessary tokens:
   
1. **Connect Your Wallet or Use Magic Link**: Depending on your chosen method, connect your wallet to the platform or sign in using your Magic Link.

3. **Click ‘Join’**: Select the ‘Join’ button associated with the PO of your choice, follow the prompts to confirm your membership, and make sure to confirm the wallet transaction to mint your membership NFT
